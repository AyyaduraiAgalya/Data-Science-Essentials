Definition:
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
Operations:
Union (|): Combine all unique elements from two sets.
Intersection (&): Find common elements between sets.
Difference (-): Find elements in one set but not the other.
Subset Check (<=): Check if one set is a subset of another.

1. What are sets in Python, and how do they differ from lists?
Answer: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, whereas lists can have duplicates and maintain order.
2. How would you remove duplicates from a list using a set?
Answer: Convert the list to a set:
``` product_list = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "date"]
    unique_products = set(product_list)
    print(unique_products)
```
3. What are sets in Python, and how do they differ from lists?
Answer: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, while lists allow duplicates and maintain order.
Use Case:
Deduplicating data:
```
    data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
    unique_data = set(data)
    print(unique_data)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```
4. How would you remove duplicates from a list using a set?
Answer: Convert the list to a set, then back to a list (if ordering doesnâ€™t matter):
```
    data = [1, 2, 2, 3]
    unique_data = list(set(data))
    print(unique_data)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

5.How would you remove duplicates from a list while maintaining order?
```
    data = [1, 2, 2, 3]
    deduplicated = []
    for item in data:
        if item not in deduplicated:
            deduplicated.append(item)
    print(deduplicated)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
