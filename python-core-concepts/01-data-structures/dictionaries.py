Definition:
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

Operations:
Access: Retrieve a value using its key.
Add/Modify: Add new key-value pairs or modify existing ones.
Delete: Remove a key-value pair.

1. What are dictionaries in Python, and how do they differ from lists?
Answer: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, while lists store ordered collections of items. Access in dictionaries is via keys, making it faster for lookups.
2. How do you merge two dictionaries in Python?
Answer: 
    In Python 3.9+, use the | operator to merge dictionaries
    In earlier versions, use update() eg. dict1.update(dict2)

LISTS VERSUS DICTIONARIES
Why It Matters in Data Science
Lists:
-Use when you need ordered data or perform iterative computations.
-Avoid searching large lists frequently, as itâ€™s slow (O(n)).

Dictionaries:
-Ideal for fast lookups and storing mappings (e.g., customer IDs to transactions).
-For large datasets, dictionaries outperform lists for accessing or updating elements.
